# Chapter 4: Data Structures

## Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable collections in Python used to store multiple items in a single variable.

## Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs used to store data in a structured manner.
